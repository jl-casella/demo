# Node.js Backend Container with Mythril Analyzer

This Docker container provides a Node.js backend server that integrates with the Mythril smart contract security analyzer through a GraphQL API.

## Usage

1. Install Docker:

   - Visit the Docker website (https://www.docker.com/) and follow the instructions to install Docker on your system.
   - Make sure Docker is running and accessible from the command line.

2. Build the Node + GraphQl backend:

   ```
   yarn build
   ```

3. Build the Backend Docker Container:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and backend source code.
   - Run the following command to build the backend Docker container:
     ```
     docker build -t backend-container .
     ```
   - This command builds the Docker image based on the Dockerfile and tags it as `backend-container`.

4. Run the Backend Docker Container:

   - Once the container is built, you can run the backend container by executing the following command:
     ```
     docker run -p 3000:3000 backend-container
     ```
   - This command starts a new Docker container based on the `backend-container` image and maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of the host machine.

5. Access the GraphQL API:

   - Open your preferred GraphQL client (e.g., GraphQL Playground or Altair).
   - Make a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
   - Use the following query to analyze a contract:
     ```graphql
     query {
       analyze($bytecode: String!) {
         output
       }
     }
     ```
   - Replace `$bytecode` with the actual contract code.

6. Stop the Backend Container:

   - To stop the backend container, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where it is running.

7. Cleanup:
   - If desired
