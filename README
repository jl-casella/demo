# Sol Analyzer demo

This demo project is a `yarn workspace` than contains:

- a NodeJS + GraphQL backend that runs in a Docker along whith the ConsenSys/mythril tool
- A VSCode extension

## Usage

1. Run the `packages/api` dockerized backend

2. Build and run the `packages/ui` VSCode extension that consumes that backend

3. Play around with the VScode extension and some Solidity code to find potential code vulnerabilities
